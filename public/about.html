            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Joshua Griffis is a passionate game developer and programmer who graduated with honours from Game Development at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Ontario. This solid foundation helped him hone his technical skills but also encouraged his already existing passion for game development.
            </p>
            <p>
                He has a fondness for Role-Playing Games (RPGs), simulations, strategy games, and cozy games that transport you to a world of comfort that you can play and relax for hours. He believes in the power that games have to tell stories, evoke emotions, and create unforgettable experiences.                </p>
            <p>
                He loves crafting intricate worlds, challenging quests, and memorable characters for his players in his tabletop games. On occasion, he also becomes a player to enjoy the stories his friends want to tell.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he is not drinking coffee in front of lines of code, you'll find him nose-deep in webnovels, webcomics, light novels, and manga. These diverse storytelling mediums fuel his imagination and provide inspiration for his game development and TTRPGs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Game development has overtaken his life having replaced playing video games with non-stop thoughts of how to design and program the mechanics he sees when playing games, having to stop and write down notes while trying to relax with his games.
